``nox`` is a command-line tool that automates testing in multiple Python environments, similar to `tox`_. Unlike tox, Nox uses a standard Python file for configuration.

Install nox via `pip`_::

    pip install --user --upgrade nox


Nox is configured via a ``noxfile.py`` file in your project's directory. Here's a simple noxfile that runs lint and some tests::

    import nox

    @nox.session
    def tests(session):
        session.install('pytest')
        session.run('pytest')

    @nox.session
    def lint(session):
        session.install('flake8')
        session.run('flake8', '--import-order-style', 'google')

To run both of these sessions, just run::

    nox

For each session, Nox will automatically create `virtualenv`_ with the appropriate interpreter, install the specified dependencies, and run the commands in order.

To learn how to install and use Nox, see the :doc:`tutorial`. For documentation on configuring sessions, see :doc:`config`. For documentation on running ``nox``, see :doc:`usage`.

Other useful projects
---------------------

Nox is not the only tool of its kind. If Nox doesn't quite fit your needs or you want to do more research, we recommend looking at these tools:

- `tox <https://tox.readthedocs.org>`__ is the de-facto standard for managing multiple Python test environments, and is the direct spiritual ancestor to Nox.
- `Invoke <https://www.pyinvoke.org/>`__ is a general-purpose task execution library, similar to Make. Nox can be thought of as if Invoke were tailored specifically to Python testing, so Invoke is a great choice for scripts that need to encompass far more than Nox's specialization.
