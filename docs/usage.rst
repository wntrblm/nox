Command-line usage
==================

Nox is normally invoked on the command line::

    nox

Specifying a different configuration file
-----------------------------------------

If for some reason your noxfile is not named *nox.py*, you can use ``--noxfile`` or ``-f``::

    nox --noxfile something.py
    nox -f something.py


Storing virtualenvs in a different directory
--------------------------------------------

By default nox stores virtualenvs in ``./.nox``, however, you can change this using ``--envdir``::

    nox --envdir /tmp/.


Listing available sessions
--------------------------

To list all available sessions, including parametrized sessions::

    nox -l
    nox --list-sessions

.. _session_execution_order:

Running all sessions
--------------------

You can run every session by just executing `nox` without any arguments:

    nox

The order that sessions are executed is determined by how they are defined in
your noxfile. if you use the :func:`decorator <nox.session>`, ``@nox.session``,
then sessions will be run by nox in the order that they appear in the noxfile.
If you define sessions using the naming convention, ``def session_<name>```
they run in alphabetical order.

If you mix and match the two methods, all sessions defined using the decorator
are run first (in order), followed by all sessions defined by the naming
convention, alphabetically.

Specifying one or more sessions
-------------------------------

By default nox will run all sessions defined in the noxfile. However, you can choose to run a particular set of them using ``--session``, ``-s``, or ``-e``::

    nox --session py27
    nox -s lint py27
    nox -e py34

Nox will run these sessions in the same order they are specified.

You can also use `pytest-style keywords`_ to filter test sessions::

    nox -k "not lint"
    nox -k "tests and not lint"

.. _pytest-style keywords: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.html#specifying-tests-selecting-tests

.. _running_paramed_sessions:

Specifying parametrized sessions
--------------------------------

If you have a :ref:`parametrized <parametrized>` session such as::

    @nox.parametrize('python_version', ['2.7', '3.4', '3.5'])
    def session_tests(session, python_version):
        ...

Then running ``nox --session tests`` will actually run all parametrized versions of the session. If you want the run the session with a particular set of parametrized arguments, you can specify them with the session name::

    nox --session "tests(python_version='2.7')"
    nox --session "tests(python_version='3.4')"


Re-using virtualenvs
--------------------

By default nox deletes and recreates virtualenvs every time it is run. This is usually fine for most projects and continuous integration environments as `pip's caching <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#caching>`_ makes re-install rather quick. However, there are some situations where it is advantageous to re-use the virtualenvs between runs. Use ``-r`` or ``--reuse-existing-virtualenvs``::

    nox -r
    nox --reuse-existing-virtualenvs

.. note::
    Re-using the existing virtualenv will skip any ``session.install()`` calls!


Stopping if any session fails
-----------------------------

By default nox will continue to run all sessions even if one fails. You can use ``--stop-on-first-error`` to make nox abort as soon as the first session fails::

    nox --stop-on-first-error


Controlling color output
------------------------

By default, Nox will output colorful logs if you're using in an interactive
terminal. However, if you are redirecting ``stderr`` to a file or otherwise
not using an interactive terminal, nox will output in plaintext.

You can manually control Nox's output using the ``--nocolor`` and ``--forcecolor`` flags.

For example, this will always output colorful logs::

    nox --forcecolor

However, this will never output colorful logs::

    nox --nocolor

Windows
-------

Nox has provisional support for running on Windows. However, depending on your Windows, Python, and virtualenv versions there may be issues. See the following threads for more info:

* `Tox issue 260 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/260>`_
* `Python issue 24493 <http://bugs.python.org/issue24493>`_
* `Virtualenv issue 774 <https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/774>`_


Converting from tox
-------------------

Nox has experimental support for converting ``tox.ini`` files into ``nox.py`` files. This doesn't support every feature of tox and is intended to just do most of the mechanical work of converting over- you'll likely still need to make a few changes to the converted ``nox.py``.

To use the converter, install ``nox`` with the ``tox_to_nox`` extra::

    pip install --upgrade nox-automation[tox_to_nox]

Then, just run ``tox-to-nox`` in the directory where your ``tox.ini`` resides::

    tox-to-nox

This will create a ``nox.py`` based on the environments in your ``tox.ini``. Some things to note:

- `Generative environments`_ work, but will be converted as individual environments. ``tox-to-nox`` isn't quite smart enough to turn these into :ref:`parametrized <running_paramed_sessions>` sessions, but it should be straightforward to manually pull out common configuration for parametrization.
- Due to the way tox parses its configuration, all `substitutions`_ are baked in when converting. This means you'll need to replace the static strings in the ``nox.py`` with appropriate variables.
- Several non-common tox options aren't implemented, but it's possible to do so. Please file a feature request if you run into one you think will be useful.
